for p in range(3):                   # Repeat three times to make three passwords
    password = ''                    # Start with an empty password
    for c in range(length):          # Build one password character by character

### Tip

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

- Make sure that the lines beneath your `for loop` keep the same indentation when you **nest** them!

</div>

## Now run your code

Click **Run**.

Enter a number when asked.  
You should see **three passwords**, each the length you chose.
